DEPRECATION WARNING: `render :text` is deprecated because it does not actually render a `text/plain` response. Switch to `render plain: 'plain text'` to render as `text/plain`, `render html: '<strong>HTML</strong>'` to render as `text/html`, or `render body: 'raw'` to match the deprecated behavior and render with the default Content-Type, which is `text/html`.

DEPRECATION WARNING: `render :text` is deprecated because it does not actually render a `text/plain` response. Switch to `render plain: 'plain text'` to render as `text/plain`, `render html: '<strong>HTML</strong>'` to render as `text/html`, or `render body: 'raw'` to match the deprecated behavior and render with the default Content-Type, which is `text/html`.

DEPRECATION WARNING: `render :text` is deprecated because it does not actually render a `text/plain` response. Switch to `render plain: 'plain text'` to render as `text/plain`, `render html: '<strong>HTML</strong>'` to render as `text/html`, or `render body: 'raw'` to match the deprecated behavior and render with the default Content-Type, which is `text/html`.

ActionController::UnknownFormat (ItemsController#upvote is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (ItemsController#edit is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (ItemsController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):
